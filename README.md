# Novoc
## A program aims to support learning English through massive novel reading

Novoc is a blend word of "Novel" and "Vocabulary". The program will first be loaded with massive amounts of text. The user can later query a given vocabulary in a reasonably short time.

## Features

Novoc currently supports reading the following file types:
* TXT Files (*.txt)
* Epub Files (*.epub)

After importing the text files, two actions could be done on their respective pages:
1. Query sentences around a vocabulary
2. Generate cloze quizzes given a word difficulty

The user could also choose to select only the sentence containing the words, or the whole paragraph.
